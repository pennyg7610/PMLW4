## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which 6 participants did their exercise (sitting, sitting down, standing, standing up, walking). This is the "classe" variable in the training set. Other variables may be utilized to predict with. This report describes how the model was built, how cross validation was used, what I think the expected out of sample error is, and why I made the choices I did. This prediction model will also be used to predict 20 different test cases.
